# Puzzle-Problem
this app is created as a university assignment.
this is a demonstration of heuristic functions and i created this 8-piece puzzle solution using a-star search method.
user can enter any sequence of number between 0-8 some validations are applied to restrict user to enter numbers only in a desired pattern.
the app then renders the numbers on a puzzle pieces in the given sequence.
after that, it calculates the minimum number of moves to solve that sequence.
